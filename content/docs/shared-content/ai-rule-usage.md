## How to use

You can use these rules in two ways:

<Steps>
## Option 1: Copy from this page

With Cursor, save the [rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai#project-rules-recommended) to `.cursor/rules/{file}` and they'll be automatically applied when working with matching files (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`).

For other AI tools, you can include these rules as context when chatting with your AI assistant - check your tool's documentation for the specific method (like using "Include file" or context commands).

## Option 2: Clone from repository

If you prefer, you can clone or download the rules directly from our [AI Rules repository](https://github.com/crialabs-labs/ai-rules).

Once added to your project, AI tools will automatically use these rules when working with {name} code. You can also reference them explicitly in prompts.
